<p>The GBS8100 is a video signal conversion card (from VGA to RGB or S-Video). It is configurable through a menu, but does not allow to save configuration changes!</p>
<p>This card listens to key presses on a GBS8100 card, and replays the key presses at startup.</p>
<p>The OpAmps on the card are used to make the inputs more readable, as they are very unstable and really hard to interpret otherwise.</p>
<p>This is an Atmel ATTiny84 based project.</p>
