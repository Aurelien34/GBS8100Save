This project contains the code for the following eletronic card:
https://easyeda.com/Bouz/GBS-8100-save
The GBS8100 is a video signal conversion card (from VGA to RGB or S-Video). It is configurable through a menu, but does not allow to save configuration changes!
This card listens to key presses on a GBS8100 card, and replays the key presses at startup.
The OpAmps on the card are used to make the inputs more readable, as they are very unstable and really hard to interpret otherwise.
This is an Atmel ATTiny84 based project.
